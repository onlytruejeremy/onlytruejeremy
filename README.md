# Welcome to my github, I'm Jeremy.
## :information_source: About Me
### I'm a full stack developer with a focus on React, Node and SQL. Lately I've been using more document-based databases and taking a dive into react-native. If you're wondering why more isn't here I've been using code sandbox a lot for building projects and learning as of late due to the ability to just pickup where you left off almost anywhere.
