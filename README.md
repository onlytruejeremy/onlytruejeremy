# Welcome to my github, I'm Jeremy.
## :information_source: About Me
### My Primary Focus is ReactJS, NodeJS and MySQL. I have built a few projects in MongoDB and MySQL. Not everything is up on github as I often spend time learning something new and moving on to the next thing once I understand the fundamental concepts or the key differences between technology. (For example, relational databases and document based ones).

## :heavy_plus_sign: Connect With Me:
### Don't hesitate to reach out to me on Linkedin or to take a look at my portfolio site.
