# Welcome to my github, I'm Jeremy.
## :information_source: About Me
### I'm a full stack web developer with a focus on ReactJS and NodeJS.

I've built many projects for fun and simply to learn, many that have never made it on here.

I'm always trying to grow as a developer and learn something new.
### What I've Used Recently
* Styled Components
* SCCS
* Webpack / Babel Setup
* Tensorflow JS
